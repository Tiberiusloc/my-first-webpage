<div class="disclaimer">
<p>This page is dedicated to the people that mean the most to me in this life. They've been there for me through thick and thin as far back as I know. So to show appreciation I will be adding to this page throughout the course of my time at <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>.</p>

<p>First up is my brother, he has been the role model for me since I was able to remember, through his kindness and leadership I truly believed and still believe that anything is possible. I've seen him grow from the kid who loved to eat and play video games to the man that now is going to have a family and has taken over and surpassed every obstacle that has been put in his way. Most of what I'm able to accomplish wouldn't even be possible if it wasn't for his guidance and help.</p>

<p>Next up is my Mom, and whew if there is someone that you strike fear into your heart but at the same time be so caring and understanding it's my mother. She has believed in me every step of the way, even sticking up for me when I know (she most likely knows too) i'm in the wrong. Yet she still puts so much faith into me to be able to accomplish any goal. I've yet to meet another mother like her and never will I just wish that some people could be as lucky as me with a mom that truly does her all for her family.</p>

<p>Now we have my Dad. This man is hard to understand at first but behind the hard shell and interior is a man that has done everything for his family from working multiple jobs to having to travel so that we his own kids could do things that were not available to him. No matter what hardships were put in front of him or how many people took advantage of him he never complained, never made any excuses and always pushed forward. He is my main role model on how to take things head on and to not look for the easy way out or excuses that make it easier to dodge the hard work. No one can compare to this man and It is amazing to see how close we've become over the years and how I will always love him.</p>

<p>Dear Skyy, 

  I have the most Love for you i’ve ever had for anyone or thing in my entire life. 
  
  I can’t imagine spending my life without you, even days without you hurt to think about. You’ve done so much for me and truly love me for who I am. I’ll always remember my birthday and how much you wanted to make my days special and do something big and take me to my favorite things. I’ll always be grateful of the amazing moments and memories we’ve had. Also I always appreciate how big of a heart you have even if you don’t always see it. Here we are 1 year and 11 months past since we’ve officially started dating but it feels like i’ve spent my entire life with you. I used to be so angry at the world and all the bad things i’ve gone through and meeting you made me change my outlook on life, you showed me there’s more things than to just be mad. That I could make something of myself more than the little box i was stuck in and for that I thank god everyday for putting an angel into my life to truly make me into the man I am today. Even when I look into the sky i’m reminded of you sometimes staring at night wondering if you are too, feeling warm because you are my soul, my happiness, my everything. My love for you deathless and forever shall I feel this way Skyy. 
  
  Love,
  Tiberius</p>
